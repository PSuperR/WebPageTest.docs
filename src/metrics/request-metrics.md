* **frame_id** - Frame ID that the request belongs to
* **is_base_page** - true if this is in the chain of requests for the base page
* **final_base_page** - true if this is the final base page request
* **initiator** - Initiator URL for what triggered the request
* **initiator_line** - Line of code in the initiator file that triggered the request
* **initiator_column** - Column of the row in the initiator file 
* **initiator_type** - Initiator type
* **priority** - Networking stack priority associated with the request when it was first sent (does not include reprioritizations)
