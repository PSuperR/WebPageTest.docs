# Custom Metric Examples

Custom metrics are an incredibly powerful way to dig deep into the characterstics of the page you're testing to surface the specific data points you're interested in collecting. Below are some useful samples to get you started.

::: note
You can find even more examples of custom metrics in [The HTTP Archive's](https://httparchive.org/) [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/custom-metrics) that collects all the WebPageTest custom metrics they use to power their reports.

Have a custom metric that you don't see here but find particularly useful? [Let us know so we can add it here and share it with everyone.](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest-docs/issues/new?title=New%20Custom%20Metric:)
