# WebPageTest API Quickstart

To get started with WebPageTest API, you'll need to first create an account [here](https://app.webpagetest.org/ui/entry/wpt/signup) and purchase a subscription plan.

If you already have an account, go to **My Account** on [WebPageTest](http://webpagetest.org/) and purchase a subscription plan by clicking on **+ API Subscription Plan**. Once you complete your purchase, you'll be able to generate the API key and start testing using the WPT API. 

We currently offer 4 subscription plans (billed monthly or annually) based on the total test runs you wish to run in a month. All our subscription plans offer the same features and capabilities. YOu can read more about account, tests, and billing or payment questions [here](http://docs.webpagetest.org/api/faqs) 

For Custom Enterprise plans where you want to run more than 25,000 tests per month, please [contact us](https://www.product.webpagetest.org/contact).

## Adding more users

Currently, we only support one user account to sign in and set up your account to purchase the WebPageTest API. However, you can generate up to 30 keys for multiple use cases and teams, from a single WebPageTest API account. You can generate a new key by clicking on **+ API consumer.**

We have plans to support adding multiple users and defining roles in the future.
